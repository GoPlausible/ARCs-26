## Abstract
This standard is inspired by <a href="https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-6551">EIP-6551</a>
The goal is to create a smart contract that will give its owner a way to bundle multiple Algo/Fungible Token/NFTs at once.


## Specification
The key words "**MUST**", "**MUST NOT**", "**REQUIRED**", "**SHALL**", "**SHALL NOT**", "**SHOULD**", "**SHOULD NOT**", "**RECOMMENDED**", "**MAY**", and "**OPTIONAL**" in this document are to be interpreted as described in <a href="https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2119.txt">RFC-2119</a>.

### Glossary
In the document, we will use the following syntax:
- Authority NFT -> NFT that detain & manage others NFTs & FTs 
- Vault -> Application ID holding NFTs & FTs of the Authority NFT

### Events
To allow wallet & dApps to identify the vault of the Authority NFT, an [ARC-28](./arc-0028.md) event MUST be emitted when creating the vault.
```json
{
  "events": [
      {
      "name": "arc41_AccountCreated",
      "desc": "Creation of a Vault",
      "args": [
        {
          "type": "address",
          "name": "account",
          "desc": "The current owner of the authority NFT"
        },
        {
          "type": "uint64",
          "name": "asaId",
          "desc": "The asaId owner of the authority NFT, (0 if application NFT)"
        },
        {
          "type": "uint256",
          "name": "tokenId",
          "desc": "The ID of the authority NFT, (0 if ASA)"
        },
        {
          "type": "uint64",
          "name": "appId",
          "desc": "The Application ID of the authority NFT, (0 if ASA)"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

An `arc41_AccountCreated` event MUST be emitted when a vault is created.


### Interface
```json
{
  "name": "ARC-41",
  "desc": "Authority NFT's Vault Base Interface",
  "methods": [
    {
      "name": "arc41_isOwner",
      "desc": "Indicate if the caller detains the Authority NFT of this vault, this method MUST be called internally by every other method of the application, it must call ARC-72 ownerOf in case of an application NFT",
      "readonly": true,
      "returns": { "type": "bool", "desc": "True if the caller detains the Authority NFT of this vault, False otherwise" }
    },
    {
      "name": "arc41_setOwner",
      "desc": "If the caller detains the Authority NFT of this vault, this method MUST set him as Owner of the vault",
      "readonly": true,
      "returns": { "type": "bool", "desc": "True if the caller detains the Authority NFT of this vault, False otherwise" }
    },
    {
      "name": "arc41_optIn",
      "desc": "Opt-in ASA in the vault",
      "readonly": false,
      "args": [
        { "type": "uint64", "name": "asaId" }
      ],
      "returns": { "type": "void" }
    },
    {
      "name": "arc41_transferAlgoTo",
      "desc": "Transfers Algos outside of the Vault",
      "readonly": false,
      "args": [
        { "type": "address", "name": "to" }
      ],
      "returns": { "type": "void" }
    },
    {
      "name": "arc41_transferTo",
      "desc": "Transfers ownership of an NFT/fungible Token",
      "readonly": false,
      "args": [
        { "type": "address", "name": "to" },
        { "type": "uint64", "name": "amount" },
        {
          "type": "uint64",
          "name": "asaId",
          "desc": "The asaId of the NFT to transfer (0 if application NFT)"
        },
        {
          "type": "uint256",
          "name": "tokenId",
          "desc": "The ID of the Smart Contract/Application NFT to transfer (0 if ASA)"
        },
        {
          "type": "uint64",
          "name": "appId",
          "desc": "The Application ID of the Smart Contract/Application NFT to transfer (0 if ASA)"
        }
      ],
      "returns": { "type": "void" }
    }
  ]
}
```

The `arc41_isOwner` method MUST be called internally by every other method.
The `arc41_setOwner` method MUST error when the caller is not the owner of authority NFT.
The `arc41_transferAlgoTo` method MUST error when `arc41_isOwner` returns false.
The `arc41_transferTo` method MUST error when `arc41_isOwner` returns false.

## Rationale
ASAs NFT following [ARC-3](./arc-0003.md), [ARC-19](./arc-0019.md) or [ARC-69](./arc-0069.md) and Application NFT ([ARC-72](./arc-0072.md)) are compatible with this standard.

## Backwards Compatibility
This standard is compatible with every NFT standard.

## Security Considerations
The method `isOwner` **MUST** be called internally by the logic of every other application method to ensure that the caller detains the Authority NFT.
